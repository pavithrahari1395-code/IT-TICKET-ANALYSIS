# IT-TICKET-ANALYSIS

Designed and implemented an analytical dashboard to evaluate IT support operations over a five-year period. The solution provided visibility into 97,498 tickets managed by 50 IT agents, enabling deeper understanding of workload distribution, resolution efficiency, and issue trends.

Highlighted consistent growth in ticket volume alongside gradual improvements in customer satisfaction.

Discovered that hardware issues dominated ticket categories and contributed significantly to the average 4.5-day resolution time.

Identified key challenges such as resource constraints, prolonged resolution cycles, and misalignment between severity and priority settings.

Delivered actionable recommendations including workload balancing, faster escalation processes, proactive hardware maintenance, and targeted training programs for support staff.

The project combined data preparation, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualization, ultimately providing a strategic view of IT support performance and guiding opportunities for operational improvements.
